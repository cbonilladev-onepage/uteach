# uTeach

This is an updated graphic tool created using Fabric.js that allows teachers to teach over video using a whiteboard-style web app.

Future updates will include small tooltips to guide through the UI, drawing tools, shapes, and a zoom function.

While video chat functionality may be integrated, that'll be put on hold to grasp basic functionality in tandem with desktop sharing software.

**Required languages**: HTML, CSS, JS, FabricJS
